.SH NAME
xmenu \- menu utility for X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmenu
.RB [ \-iw ]
.RB [ -p
.IR position ]
.RI [ title ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xmenu
is a menu for X,
it reads a list of newline-separated items from stdin,
shows a menu for the user to select one of the items,
and outputs the item selected to stdout.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B -i
Disable icons.
.B xmenu
allocates a space at the left side of the menu for the icons;
if there is no icon, then this space will be blank.
Setting the
.B -i
option removes this space, making the menu narrower.
.TP
.BI -p " position"
Set the position to spawn xmenu.
Without this option, xmenu spawns next to the cursor.
.I position
is a string of the form
.BR INTxINT ,
where the first INT is the x position and the second INT is the y position.
.TP
.B -w
Asks the window manager to draw a border around the menus.
This option may be buggy in some window managers,
specially tiled ones that do not respect window hints.
.PP
Each item read from stdin has the following format:
.IP
.EX
ITEM := [TABS] [[IMAGE TABS] LABEL [TABS OUTPUT]] NEWLINE
.EE
.PP
That means that each item is composed by
tabs, followed by an optional image specification, followed by tabs
followed by a label, followed by more tabs, followed by an output,
and ended by a newline.  Brackets group optional elements.
.IP
The initial tabs indicate the menu hierarchy:
items indented with a tab is shown in a submenu of the preceding item not indented.
An item without initial tabs is a top-level item.
.IP
The image is a string of the form "IMG:/path/to/image.png".
It specifies a image to be shown as icon at the left of the entry.
.IP
The label is the string that will be shown as a item in the menu.
An item without label is considered a separator and is drawn as a thin line in the menu
separating the item above from the item below.
.IP
The output is the string that will be output after selecting the item.
If an item does not have an output, its label is used as its output.
.IP
The newline terminates the item specification.
.PP
If the argument
.I title
is given, the title of the menu window is set to it.
